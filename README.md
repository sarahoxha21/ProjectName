# Project Details

## Project Title: Online Grocery Shop Platform
## Need Analysis: 
Based on the research we conducted online we gathered some data that displays the current and future trends in the grocery delivery market in Albania. This data shows the market's growth potential. 
1. The projected revenue in the Grocery Delivery market in Albania is expected to reach US$52.16 million in 2024. This shows a market opportunity for online grocery delivery services in the country.
2. The market is expected to demonstrate an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2028) of 17.70%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$100.10 million by 2028. This suggests a growing demand for grocery delivery services among Albanian consumers.
3. Albania's grocery delivery market is experiencing a rise in demand as consumers increasingly prioritize convenience and safety. [1]
4. Lastly, the lack of online grocery shopping platforms beyond Spar in Albania expresses a significant gap in the market. While there is growing demand for grocery delivery services, the current options are limited. 



## Problem Statement:
We observed a shortage of dedicated online grocery ordering platforms in Albania, resulting in limited options for consumers seeking convenient and efficient grocery shopping experiences. This scarcity forces consumers to depend on traditional shopping methods, which may not align with their preference for convenience and time-saving benefits.


## Solution Proposed:
We propose to address this problem by developing a dedicated online grocery ordering platform serving the needs of Albanian consumers.This platform will offer a wide selection of products and provide users with a smooth and convenient shopping experience. 
Our platform will feature a visually appealing interface, designed to simplify the shopping process for users. With organized categories, users can browse products, place orders, and schedule deliveries, upgrading their overall shopping experience.

Some of the technologies that are going to be used:
1. Frontend: HTML, CSS
2. Backend: PHP


## Project Scope:
- **Aim:** Our project aims to revolutionize the grocery shopping experience by developing a user-friendly web/app solution that addresses common challenges faced by Albanian customers.
- **Main Objectives:**
1. Enhance convenience and efficiency in grocery shopping.
2. Improve inventory management and real-time updates.
3. Offer flexible delivery options to suit user needs.

- **Boundaries and limitations:**
- While we’ll try to ensure that the platform functions smoothly across a variety of devices and web browsers, the platform may not be optimized for all devices or screen sizes.
- The platform will focus on serving the Albanian market and will not support international shipping or transactions.


## Application Description:
Our application will feature a user-friendly interface that allows customers to browse through a wide selection of products, add items to their cart, and complete transactions.
The primary users of the software are Albanian consumers who seek a convenient and efficient way of purchasing groceries online. This includes individuals and families looking for a convenient alternative to traditional shopping methods.
1. Users will be able to create their own account and login into our website.
2. Our platform will offer a wide variety of products all of which will be categorized in different sections so that the users will find it easier browsing the page.
3. Securely complete transactions and choose from flexible delivery options, the users will have access to select their preferred delivery day. The users will have to choose one of the two selections based on preferences on the payment method. They could either choose the In-Person Payment or Debit/Credit Card Payment.

To ensure that our application addresses users' needs, it's important to understand and prioritize their requirements.
