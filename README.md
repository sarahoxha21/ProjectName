# Application Specifications
**Design Architecture Diagram**
Our online grocery shopping platform follows a client-server architecture, with distinct frontend and backend components interacting to provide a seamless user experience. Below is an overview of the system components and their interactions:
- Client (User Interface):
The client represents the user interface through which customers interact with the platform.
It includes the web interface accessible via web browsers.
- Frontend:
The frontend component is responsible for enabling the user interface elements and managing user interactions. It uses technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing UI. The frontend communicates with the backend to request data and handle user actions, such as browsing products, adding items to the cart, and placing orders.
Backend:
- The backend component serves as the server-side logic responsible for processing requests from the frontend and interacting with the database. It is built using technologies such as PHP for handling business logic. The backend handles managing user accounts, processing orders, and updating inventory.
- Database:
The database stores data for the application, including user profiles, product listings, orders, and transaction details. It uses a relational database management system (MySQL) to ensure data integrity and reliability. The backend communicates with the database to retrieve and store information, ensuring secure data management and persistence.

**System Interactions:**
1. User interactions with the client initiate HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints.
2. The frontend communicates with the backend to retrieve data, update user sessions etc.
3.The backend interacts with the database to fetch or update data based on the user's actions and application requirements.
4. Responses from the backend are sent back to the frontend, where they are processed and used to update the UI accordingly.

**Database Model**
- Admin Table:
Attributes: id (Primary Key), name, mobile, email, password, image
Stores information about admins who have access to the system.
- Cart Table:
Attributes: cartid (Primary Key), itemid, userid (Foreign Key)
This table represents the cart items added by users. Each row corresponds to an item added to the cart by a specific user.
- Items Table:
Attributes: itemid (Primary Key), Title, category, item_rating, image, discription, price
This table contains details of available items for purchase, including their title, category, rating, image, description, and price.
- Order Table:
Attributes: id (Primary Key), item_name, price, Quantity, total
This table stores information about orders, including the ordered item's name, price, quantity, and total cost.
- Payment Table:
Attributes: id (Primary Key), cardnumber, card_expairy, cvc_code, amount, userid (Foreign key)
This table stores payment details for orders, including the payment amount, card information, and associated user.
- User Table:
Attributes: userid (Primary Key), name, mobile, email, password
Stores information about registered users, including their name, contact details, email, and password.

**Relationships:**

*Cart-Items Relationship(Many-to-many):*
The Cart table has a foreign key (item_id) referencing the Items table. Each item in the Items table can be linked with multiple carts (many), as it can be added to carts by multiple users. Each cart in the Cart table can contain multiple items (many). This results in a many-to-many relationship between the Cart and Items tables.

*Payment-User Relationship(One-to-many):*
The Payment table has a foreign key (userid) referencing the User table, linking payment records to specific users. Each payment record in the Payment table is linked with one user (one). However, each user can have multiple payment records (many), as users can make multiple transactions. Therefore, this relationship is one-to-many.

*Cart-User Relationship(One-to-many):*
Each user can have multiple carts (many), as users can add items to their cart multiple times or have multiple active carts. However, each cart is linked with only one user (one), as carts belong to individual users. 

**Constraints:**
- Primary Keys:
Each table has a primary key constraint defined, ensuring that each record is uniquely identifiable.
- Foreign Keys:
There are foreign key constraints defined in the Cart, User and Payment tables, linking them to the Items, Cart and User tables, respectively.
- Other Relevant Details:
Auto-Increment:
Some tables have auto-incremented primary keys, ensuring that unique identifiers are automatically assigned to new records.

**Technologies Used**
- *Frontend*

HTML: will be used to create the structure of the webpage

CSS: will be used to style and design the layout of the webpages

Bootstrap: frontend framework

JavaScript: to add interactivity between web pages

jQuery: library of JavaScript

- *Backend*

PHP: logic of website and will be used to make the connection between the database

MySQL: used to store all data

- *Other*

Github: used to track changes and increase collaboration between team members

**User Interface Design:**

**Security Measures:**

Authentication: Secure hashing of passwords that will be inputted by users.

Data privacy: We will comply with GDPR regulations for data transparency.

# Phase 4 Software Testing

 **Introduction to Testing**
-Software testing is the methodical process of assessing a system or program to find errors, faults, or any differences between the results that are expected and those that are obtained. It includes a range of strategies and procedures to guarantee that the software satisfies requirements and operates as intended. Software testing is essential to the development process since it enhances the software's functionality, dependability, and quality.

**Purpose of Testing**
Testing is essential to making sure the platform works well and fulfills the needs of the company and its consumers in the setting of an online grocery store. Why testing is important is as follows:

- *Reliability:* Consumers count on the internet grocery store to deliver precise details about goods, costs, and stock levels. Testing contributes to the platform's increased reliability by assisting in the identification and resolution of problems that may result in inaccurate data or system outages.

- *Correctness:* The website must operate flawlessly, free from bugs or strange behaviours. Testing ensures a flawless user experience by confirming that all features and functionalities operate as intended.

- *Client Satisfaction:* A thoroughly tested website results in happier customers because visitors have less trouble navigating, finding what they're looking for, placing orders, and paying for it. Positive experiences like these promote repeat business and client loyalty.

- *Expense-effectiveness:* Defects found later in the development cycle are more expensive to fix than those found early on, especially if the platform has already been put into production. Testing saves time and resources by assisting in the early detection and correction of issues.

**Goals of Testing**
There are two goals for testing the online grocery store website:
Early Defect Identification: The goal of testing is to find bugs or problems in the program at the earliest stage of its development. Through early identification and remediation of these errors, the development team may minimize the likelihood that they will later become more serious issues, therefore lowering the total cost and labor associated with their repair.
Software Component Verification: Testing makes sure that every part of the website—including the shopping cart, payment gateway, search feature, and product listings—works as it should. It entails verifying that these elements comply to the expected behavior and fulfill the requirements as stated, guaranteeing the overall functioning and quality of the webpage.
In conclusion, testing is essential if the online grocery store website is to provide consumers with a dependable, easy-to-use, and error-free experience while lowering the risks and expenses related to software flaws.

*We decided to use PHPUnit as a testing framework since our code is written in PHP.*

**Checkout Testing**
