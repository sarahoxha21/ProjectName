# Project Details

## Project Title: Online Grocery Shop Platform
## Need Analysis: 
Based on the research we conducted online we gathered some data that displays the current and future trends in the grocery delivery market in Albania. This data shows the market's growth potential. Here are some key takeaways:
1. The projected revenue in the Grocery Delivery market in Albania is expected to reach US$52.16 million in 2024. This shows a market opportunity for online grocery delivery services in the country.
2. The market is expected to demonstrate an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2028) of 17.70%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$100.10 million by 2028. This suggests a growing demand for grocery delivery services among Albanian consumers.
3. Albania's grocery delivery market is experiencing a rise in demand as consumers increasingly prioritize convenience and safety. [1]
4. Lastly, the lack of online grocery shopping platforms beyond Spar in Albania expresses a significant gap in the market. While there is growing demand for grocery delivery services, the current options are limited.



## Problem Statement:
We observed a shortage of dedicated online grocery ordering platforms in Albania, resulting in limited options for consumers seeking convenient and efficient grocery shopping experiences. This scarcity forces consumers to depend on traditional shopping methods, which may not align with their preference for convenience and time-saving benefits.


## Solution Proposed:
We propose to address this problem by developing a dedicated online grocery ordering platform serving the needs of Albanian consumers.This platform will offer a wide selection of products and provide users with a smooth and convenient shopping experience. 
Our platform will feature a visually appealing interface, designed to simplify the shopping process for users. With organized categories, users can browse products, place orders, and schedule deliveries, upgrading their overall shopping experience.
